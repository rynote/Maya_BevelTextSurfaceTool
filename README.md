# Maya_BevelTextSurfaceTool
A little tool to help you select poly surfaces based on their Normal. Easily assign different shaders to bevels and extrusions


I dug up this handy tool I created a few years ago.
It solves the problem of needing to select Face / Bevel / Side for creating cool 3D text with shaders mapped to the different elements.

To use, source the script and then enter the command ‘rg_bevelTextFaceTool_PassShader’
